                    This app, <span id="scoreStack">ScoreStack</span> was made by Shafan R., Andrew H., and Ethan L. We had made this app during the last week of a course called AllStarCode
                    and the last week consisted of developing a project including skills we had learnt throughout the entire 6 week course, and so 
                    we decided on making an app for students, specifically taking the SAT soon, both to show our skill, and help others.

                    Our team leveraged the skills we acquired over six weeks of rigorous coding including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and user experience design. We combined these technical abilities with a shared comitment to acidemic excellence.
