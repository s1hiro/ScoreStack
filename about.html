                    This app, <span id="scoreStack">ScoreStack</span> was made by Shafan R., Andrew H., and Ethan L. We had made this app during the last week of a course called AllStarCode
                    and the last week consisted of developing a project including skills we had learnt throughout the entire 6 week course, and so 
                    we decided on making an app for students, specifically taking the SAT soon, both to show our skill, and help others.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="p2">
                    Our team leveraged the skills we acquired over six weeks of rigorous coding including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and user experience design.
                    We combined these technical abilities with a shared comitment to acidemic excellence.
